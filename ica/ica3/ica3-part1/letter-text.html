    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h1>

    <article>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.</p>

        <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your studies at any time. However, it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>Find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

        <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall within the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and we’d love to have you on our team.</p>
        <p>Among the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on funk bass player performance at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Could you provide more details on each subject, including estimated research duration, required staff, and other resources? Thanks.</p>

        <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. My favorite dances include:</p>

        <h3>Polynesian Chicken Dance</h3>
        <p class="indent">A little-known but influential dance dating back to 300 BC. A whole village would dance in a circle like chickens to encourage livestock to be "fruitful."</p>

        <h3>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</h3>
        <p class="indent">Before the Icelanders discovered fire, they developed this dance to stay warm. It involved huddling in a circle and shuffling rapidly in tiny, imperceptible movements. Some say this inspired modern styles like Twerking.</p>

        <h3>Arctic Robot Dance</h3>
        <p class="indent">English explorers in the 1960s mistakenly thought they discovered a "robotic" dance style among Northern Alaskan and Canadian inhabitants. Later, they realized the movements were due to extreme cold.</p>

        <p>For more on my research, visit my <a href="http://example.com">exotic dance research page</a>.</p>

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
        <p>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</p>
